# album-reviews
This website was made as a project for my intermediate web design and programming class using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features album reviews, and has sorting, log in, filtering, and tagging functionality!

Deployment has been terminated due to Heroku policies, but feel free to view my code!
